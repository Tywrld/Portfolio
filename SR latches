#SR latch



#How do computers remember?

Computers can remember various numbers and store them as bits. They can do this by using gates and latches. Latches hold information unless they are changed.
By connecting multiple latches together you can store larger bits of memory 

#What is a SR latch?

One of the most common ways computers store memory is in a SR latch or Set/Reset latch. But to understand how they work we first must decontruct it.

A SR latch is composed of 2 NOR gates in which the output of one is going into the input of the other and the output of the second one is going back into the the first.
