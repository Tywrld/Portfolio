1.This is a Adafruit NeoPixel Stick. It's a small circuit board with 8 RGB (red, green, and blue) LEDs. Each LED can be individually addressed </br>
  It can be controlled using a microcontroller pin and operates on 5V direct Current. It can also be chainable



2.This component is a ultrasonic distance sensor. The name of this sensor is HC-SR04. It produces sound waves that are inaudible to he human ear and then calculate   the time it takes for the sound to come back. <br/>

  It's accurate up to 3mm in tolerance and can measure up to 450cm on a 40kHz Frequency <br/>
  operates on 5V direct Current



3.ignoring the blue wheel, this piece is from the LEGO SPIKE set. It functions as a motor and a sensor, and can be connected to a LEGO SPIKE hub with a cable. You can connect a plethora of components to the end of it



4.This is a camera module for the Raspberry Pi. It is a 8 mega pixel camera and can record video up to 1080p resolution at 30 fps
It connects using a CSI interface



5.This is a temperature sensor. The ID of this module is DS18B20, it can measure temperatures up to -55c to 125c. <br/>
It communicates with 1-wire bus, needing only 1 data line. <br/>
No need for external power.



6.This is a Raspberry Pi build hat. In my case I'm using it for LEGO Technic compatibility.



7.This is a 20pin connector its used to make connections to circuit boards or a Raspberry Pi.



8.This is another camera module compatible with LEGO and Raspberry Pi's. <br/>
The ribbon cable go out to a LAN connector to send and receive data and power



9.Just a normal Speaker :)



10.A breadboard Vending Machine build


11. A Wii remote
