# Maximizing_Profits_using_LP

In this module we are trying to maximize the profits of chairs and table sales using linear programming in Python.

1. In this problem we have to maximize profits with 600sqft of wood per day with each chair costing 5sqft and table costing 20sqft.
5x+20y≤600


3. We are allotted 120 labor hours per day with each chair costing 2 hours to produce and table costing 5 hours to produce.  <br />
2x+5y≤120


4. and we only have a storage space of 50 items per day.  <br />
x+y≤50

We have 2 varibles:  <br />
X = Num of chairs made per day  <br />
Y = Num of tables made per day

and 3 constraints:  <br />
Wood availability <= 600  <br />
Labor Hours       <= 120  <br />
Storage space     <= 50

Our Objective Function is the cost:  <br />
ChairC = 5  <br />
TableC = 20

Using LP we can see that to maximize our profits we need to produce 44 Chairs and 6 Tables per day

# Neural Networks

A neural network or NN is a machine learning algroithm that uses series of interconnected nodes to evaluate data. It's kinda like our brains and how we have neurons that bring signals to other parts of it

The simple components of a Neural Network is as follows:<br />
Input layer- Artificial neurons recieve input or direction from other artificial neurons<br />
Hidden Layer- Usally contains nodes that process the input layer nodes. The hidden layer usally contains multiple layers<br />
Output Layer- Gives an output thats different than whats put in<br />

If you navigate to my Neural Network file you can find more examples and more descriptions
