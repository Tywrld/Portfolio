# Maximizing_Profits_using_LP

In this module we are trying to maximize the profits of chairs and table sales using linear programming in Python.

1. In this problem we have to maximize profits with 600sqft of wood per day with each chair costing 5sqft and table costing 20sqft.
5x+20y≤600


3. We are allotted 120 labor hours per day with each chair costing 2 hours to produce and table costing 5 hours to produce.  <br />
2x+5y≤120


4. and we only have a storage space of 50 items per day.  <br />
x+y≤50

We have 2 varibles:  <br />
X = Num of chairs made per day  <br />
Y = Num of tables made per day

and 3 constraints:
Wood availability <= 600
Labor Hours       <= 120
Storage space     <= 50

Our Objective Function is the cost:
ChairC = 5
TableC = 20

Using LP we can see that to maximize our profits we need to produce 44 Chairs and 6 Tables per day
